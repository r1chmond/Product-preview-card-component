## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- Flexbox
- CSS
- [Styled Components](https://fontawesome.com/icons/cart-shopping?s=regular&f=classic) - For cart logo

### What I learned

Using media query and the content property in css to change the images.

To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
<img class="image" src="/images/image-product-desktop.jpg" alt="perfume" />
```

```css
.image-section {
  content: url(/images/image-product-mobile.jpg);
  border-top-left-radius: 8px;
  border-top-right-radius: 8px;
}
```

### Continued development

Responsive web design

### Useful resources

- (https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/) - This helped me with the curved corners. I learnt that the border-top-left-radius property targets the top left only.
  It also helped with centering the entire section/div.
